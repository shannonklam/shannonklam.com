			<div class="heading">My Hours</div>
			<p class="text">You can officially reach me on Slack (<a href="http://kinsta.slack.com/team/U01MVSGPG4T" target="_blank">@shannon</a>) from <strong>7:30 to 16:30 PST</strong>, Monday through Friday.</p>
			<p class="text">When it comes to actually doing my work, though, it's a different story. I focus best in small chunks, so I tend to start my work early in the morning and not finish until late at night.</p>
			<p class="text">Here's a typical day for me:</p>
			<ul class="list">
				<li class="item" role="listitem"><strong>6:30:</strong> Wake up</li>
				<li class="item" role="listitem"><strong>7:00:</strong> Work</li>
				<li class="item" role="listitem"><strong>10:30:</strong> Walk the dogs</li>
				<li class="item" role="listitem"><strong>11:30:</strong> Work</li>
				<li class="item" role="listitem"><strong>13:00:</strong> Do chores/run errands</li>
				<li class="item" role="listitem"><strong>17:30:</strong> Work</li>
				<li class="item" role="listitem"><strong>19:00:</strong> Have dinner</li>
				<li class="item" role="listitem"><strong>21:00:</strong> Work</li>
				<li class="item" role="listitem"><strong>22:30:</strong> Go to bed</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="text">You'll also find me working on the weekends pretty regularly.</p>
			<div class="callout">Why do I split up my work so much?</div>
			<p class="text">Because it gives me a chance to ruminate on what I've read or researched instead of running with my first impression. I find the quality of my work improves this way.</p>

				<p class="text slack">Slack is always the best way to get in touch with me. Please <a href="http://kinsta.slack.com/team/U01MVSGPG4T" target="_blank">send me a Slack message</a> at any time! I promise you won't be bothering me. If I'm not available, I'll just respond when I'm next online.</p>
				<p class="text">For video meetings, I usually use Google Hangouts or Zoom. Feel free to <a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=c2hhbm5vbmxhbUBraW5zdGEuY29t" target="_blank">schedule a video chat</a> with me anytime! I just ask for at least a day's heads-up to plan around our call. That way, I can make sure you'll have my full, undivided attention.</p>

			<div class="heading">How I Communicate</div>
			<p class="text">I may be an introvert, but that doesn't mean I don't like chatting with my teammates! I love getting to know the people I'm working with.</p>
			<p class="text">I try to be friendly, honest, and open when communicating. My goal is to avoid time-wasting misunderstandings; to that end, I work hard to fully explain what I'm thinking (so forgive me if I get a little verbose at times!).</p>
			<p class="text">Here's what will help me communicate with you best:</p>
			<ul class="list">
				<li class="item" role="listitem"><strong>Be specific.</strong> The more detailed, the better! I'd rather have too much to review than too little.</li>
				<li class="item" role="listitem"><strong>Provide a timeframe.</strong> It's okay if you don't have a firm due date in mind. A rough timeline should be enough to give me an idea of how to prioritize your ask.</li>
				<li class="item" role="listitem"><strong>Don't wait.</strong> The sooner we can get the ball rolling, the more time we'll have to iron things out. This goes doubly if there's an existing issue you're bringing to light. Don't sit on it! Let me know so I can get to fixing it right away.</li>
				<li class="item" role="listitem"><strong>Don't be afraid to bring it up!</strong> We're all professionals who value reasoned discussion and debate. I will always assume you mean well; you won't hurt my feelings.</li>

			<div class="heading">Fun Facts</div>
			<p class="text">You can learn a little about me from <a href="/">my homepage</a>, <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/shannonklam" target="_blank">my LinkedIn</a>, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/shannonklam" target="_blank">my Instagram</a>. But here are some fun tidbits that aren't listed elsewhere:</p>
			<ul class="list">
				<li class="item" role="listitem"><strong>One of my degrees is in archaeology.</strong> It was always my dream to dig up dead civilizations and share them with the world! Technical work suits me better in the long run, though.</li>
				<li class="item" role="listitem"><strong>I have perfect pitch.</strong> I used to sing in musical theater, where it often came in very handy.</li>
				<li class="item" role="listitem"><strong>I grew up in rural Connecticut.</strong> I live in San Diego now, which is a wonderful city, but I miss being surrounded by trees, not to mention the seasons.</li>				
				<li class="item" role="listitem"><strong>I set a yearly reading goal.</strong> My goal for 2021 is 52 books—one per week. You can check out my progress <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/shannonklam" target="_blank">on Goodreads</a>. And I'm always looking for recommendations, so please send your favorite titles my way!</li>
				<li class="item" role="listitem"><strong>I'm a classic <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/intp-personality" target="_blank">INTP-T</a>.</strong> Even though the Myers-Briggs test is largely based on incomplete data, I think it's still a great tool for understanding myself and the people around me.</li>
